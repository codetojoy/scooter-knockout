# General 

- Strive for DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself
- Balance YAGNI "You're Not Gonna Need It" with "Design in the Future Tense"
- Prefer immutable state
- In appropriate languages (e.g. Java), prefer interfaces
- Unit tests are crucial
- Integration tests are good if they can be managed reasonably
- Consider observability with stop-watches to time backend API calls
- Log liberally and yet judiciously 
- Balance clean, maintainable code with using best practices and modern features of the language
- Balance pragmatism with elegance
