# General 

- where possible, prefer 1980s retro styling from early home computing era
    - however do not introduce blur or low-fidelity: the UI should still be crisp
- build for both mobile and desktop with best practices (e.g. breakpoints in CSS)
- follow ARIA guidelines for accessibility
- assume North American, Anglophone audience and do not purse i18n or localization
- write tests with Playwright or similar tools
- strive for both dark/light themes
- provide tool tips on input fields
